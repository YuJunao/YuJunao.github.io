<h2>Sports: </h2>
    <p>
      I like playing sports. Basketball is one of my favorite ball games and I usually play center or power forward. 
      I participated in the Gauss Cup basketball game held by the mathematics and physics school. Our team made an effort but failed to be qualified for the final. 
      Our opponents were skillful and I learned a lot of techniques and strategies from them.

    <p>
      I picked up running after being motivated by the Runner's Association in USTC when I entered the university. 
      I prefer long-distance running thanks to my exerllent patience. 
      I always perform well in the 1000-meter and 12-min tests. I can cover 2.8km in 12 minutes, qualified for full marks.
      Particularly, I can run Half-Marathon. My personal best record was 1h44min, and I wish I would reduce it to 100min one day.

<h2>Arts: </h2>
    <p>
      I learned playing the acoustic guitar in the summer vacation after my college entrance examination, and joined the Guitar's Association immediately after I entered USTC. 
      I prefer to playing and singing. My interest lies in Chinese pop music, such as those composed by JJ Lin or Jay Chou.
      After training myself consistently, I am now confident in my singing skills. Actually, my vocal range could reach the two-line octave when I am on form.
